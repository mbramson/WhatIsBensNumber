# WhatIsBensNumber
Ben is thinking of a number. The person that guesses Ben's number will get his framed picture of Carlton. If I can ask suitably interesting questions about the number, Ben will answer them. This project is an effort to narrow down the number, and then abstract the problem such that we can predict the questions to ask that narrow down the number most efficiently.

Given an estimated upper bound on the number, this should eventually inform which questions you should ask.
