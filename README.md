# WhatIsBensNumber
Ben is thinking of a number. The person that guesses Ben's number will get his framed picture of Carlton. If I can ask suitably interesting questions about the number, Ben will answer them. This project is an effort to narrow down the number, and then abstract the problem such that we can predict the questions to ask that narrow down the number most efficiently.

Given an estimated upper bound on the number, this should eventually inform which questions you should ask.

We've guessed the number. It was 51. However, this is still an interesting problem for abstraction!

##What we know so far.

1. Primeness
  1. The number is not prime
  2. The number has two unique prime factors
  3. The number has two total prime factors.
2. It is a Motzkin Number
  * This narrows it down considerably, in fact I've guessed it now. How boring.
